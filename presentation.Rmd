# What is Machine Learning?

- A field of computer science that gives computers the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

---
# Why Deep Learning?

- Subset of machine learning
- Uses a neural network to simulate how the human brain learns

---
# What is a Neural Network?

Neural Network image

---
# How does a neural network learn?

- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation

---
# What software is available for deep learning?

Keras, TensorFlow, etc.

---
# Intro to Keras

---
# MNIST Example

Switch to R?
---
# Loss Reserving Case Study

This will take multiple slides.
