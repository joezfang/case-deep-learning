# Agenda

- Introduction to Deep Learning

- Hands-on Keras Demo

- Loss Reserving Case Study

- Q+A and Open Discussion

---
# What is Machine Learning?

- A field of computer science that gives computers the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

---
# Why Deep Learning?

- Subset of machine learning

- Uses a neural network to simulate how the human brain learns

- Performs better than traditional machine learning techniques for large datasets
