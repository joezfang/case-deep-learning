# Actuarial applications of deep learning

This is the repository for the presentation *Actuarial applications of deep learning: loss reserving and beyond* at the 2018 CAS Spring Meeting.

## Contribution instructions

Fork the repo. Make changes to `presentation.Rmd`. Run `build.R` to build the slides in `static/` (note that hitting the `Knit` button will build the `.html` in the root directory). Send a PR against master. You can see a deployment preview by going to `Show all checks -> Details` on the PR page once it's been built.
