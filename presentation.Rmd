---
# What is Machine Learning?

- A field of computer science that gives computers the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed

---
# Why Deep Learning?

- Subset of machine learning

- Often uses a neural network to simulate how the human brain learns

- Performs better than traditional machine learning techniques for large datasets

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='60%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/deep-learning.png")
```

# What software is available for deep learning?

- Front-end/programming language

    - R, Python

- Interface between front and back end

    - Keras

- Back-end for calculations

    - TensorFlow, Theano

# Intro to Keras

- Keras is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation

# MNIST Example

Let's switch to R!

# Q&A and Discussion

Hello!

# Loss reserving case study

# "Claims liabilities Estimation"

Basically, figure out what we gotta pay in the future due to claims.

---

# Example triangle

```{r}
library(insuranceData)
data(IndustryAuto)
head(IndustryAuto, 12)
```

---

# Actually a triangle

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# look at data as of calendar year 2002
data <- IndustryAuto %>%
  filter(Incurral.Year + Development.Year - 1 <= 2002)
# convert to triangle format
data %>%
  spread(Development.Year, Claim)
```

---

# Treat this as a predictive modeling problem

Each cell of the triangle is a row in the modeling dataset.

We just need to come up with some predictors

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data %>%
  mutate(predictors = "?!?!") %>%
  head(5)
```

Then we can do something like

```{r, eval = FALSE}
crazy_AI_algorithm(Claim ~ predictors, data = data)
```

---

# Rules for predictors

Really, just one rule, and that is

> The information used to derive the predictors for a cell must be available before the calendar period associated with the cell.

I.e. we're not cheating and looking into the future.
